# Hi, I'm Ethan!

I'm a first year BSc Computer Science student at Lancaster University.

I'm a keen and ambitious student. As an aspiring software engineer and computer scientist, I am always willing and eager to gain knowledge and build my skills in the field of computer science. I am a strong problem-solver with a great work ethic, attention to detail, and passion for technology.

I am always seeking to learn more about these concepts and keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
